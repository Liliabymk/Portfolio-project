        "fullDescription": "In this project, my team and I constructed and tested three fundamental logic gates—NOT, AND, and OR—using a solderless breadboard and a kit of discrete components including PN2222 NPN transistors, various resistors, and pushbuttons. To understand the circuit design, we first did some research and watched explanatory videos. We then applied this knowledge to build the circuits sequentially, starting with the simpler NOT gate before assembling the more complex OR and AND gates, utilizing LEDs to visually verify the correct logic output for each configuration.",

Our goal was to demystify artificial intelligence and programming for a group with limited access to such technology. Using Microsoft MakeCode, we designed and delivered an engaging, hands-on workshop tailored to our audience’s needs. Beyond the technical instruction, I played a key role in curriculum delivery and content creation, culminating in a recap documentary that highlighted our community's progress and celebrated their achievement with official certificates of completion.",
